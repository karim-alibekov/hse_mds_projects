    "    – Aggregator is good for basic classification, however it doesn't reflect the complex reality of airfare pricing. First of all, prices are dynamic due to demand for concrete direction. Moreover categorization reflects subjective understanding of what is good and bad. For someone the cheapest ticket with any amount of transfers would be the best option, so it's useful to know what priorities of our customers are. Another point is that 4 criterias is not enough for classification (in alternative categorization I'll show what other criterias might be). The best idea is to classify tickets not by subjective categorization, but by the status of tariff. Overall, the aggregator is subjective, basic and not flexible."
